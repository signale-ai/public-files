      "2023-07-17 23:46:10+00:00 maybe with directional feature added it would be near ideal 429184688\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:45:34+00:00 things like v3 sound quite good for smallish single chain trades 429184688\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:44:30+00:00 would agree it can improve cross chain trading, but somehow more skeptical it improves single chain trading at least for small enough trades 429184688\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:40:50+00:00 Less transparent? Probably. Probably gonna 10x the ofac'ing and trm data exfiltration on the official UI too. But, unfortunately, users don't care 464619027\n",

      "The introduction of the whitepaper explains some ways this is achieved, mainly that builders are able to source liquidity from many different places, which imo implies Uniswap liquidity on other chains 321020476\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:37:58+00:00 It's good for users and an Ethereum merge moment for lps, if my understanding of the paper is correct 464619027\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:36:55+00:00 This isn't complicated to reason about. Users don't have to mess around with gas. That alone is a meaningful improvement because Uniswap is doing it 464619027\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:35:57+00:00 well with X in the name crosschain branding seems easy 944112569\n",

      "2023-07-17 23:32:31+00:00 wouldn‚Äôt call that a huge improvement especially if you‚Äôre on a single chain 429184688\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:32:29+00:00 You can still LP if you want to. I'd imagine most passive LP income even now is from arb bots fixing the slot0 price against exchanges and other DEXes anyway. Hard to get real data on this but my intuition tells me this is the case. And it won't stop being the case, you can still LP and earn fees from arb bots fixing the wrong price on your LP 321020476\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:31:38+00:00 a huge UX improvement; tokens get pushed to you and you dont have any hassle with gas 785943617\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:30:50+00:00 Yeah that's a strategy I employ on some bags, I will set them fairly wide and be happy if my bag fills with either X or Y token, and just wide enough to make the fees meaningful. \n",
      "I also like it for 'reading' the market, seeing where liquidity is shallow, and where it is deep, and at what levels there is a  'backstop' or a 'wall' of liquidity. 944112569\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:30:24+00:00 Not sure how much I like this uniswapx, feels less transparent to users than v3/v4. Also not sure what‚Äôs the benefit for users, besides the cross chain aspect 429184688\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:27:38+00:00 You do, but potentially less than if you're not an lp, and many (very loudly) didn't like that. And now it looks like the \"problem\" is being solved, permanently, by just getting rid of lps. Can't have \"IL\" if you don't have lps 464619027\n",

      "2023-07-17 23:26:28+00:00 Never liked LP on V2, found it was far riskier, V3 is nicer, and you can use it in far more interesting ways. 944112569\n",

      "2023-07-17 23:07:31+00:00 There is no other possible outcome. Traders won't use a system exclusively because LPs are incentivized or have opportunity there, they will always prefer to use the platform that gives them a better price 321020476\n",

      "2023-07-17 23:03:47+00:00 I dont think it will work that way, since they wont leave the fees to the remaining LPs, the order flow will go to fillers instead. 785943617\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:03:20+00:00 The fees are directly correlated to the tvl and volatility after doing this, 2 directional volume eliminated 372324021\n",
      "2023-07-17 23:02:38+00:00 It's an equilbrium anyway. If passive LPs aren't profitible because being an active market maker is better then some passive LPs will withdraw and leave a higher proportion of fees to those who remain. The opportunity is to be able to swap your tokens for other tokens in a decentralized way. How that is achieved is through the most effective way possible, and who gets paid to provide that service is the one who offers the best swap outcome, whatever that ends up being 321020476\n",

      "I think as well plenty of people use V3 like a sort of order book, placing their tokens in tight ranges and removing their LP when it's passed the ticks. So this seems like something those peeps will use, Some DAOs did this with ARB airdrop for example. 944112569\n",

They likely won‚Äôt hire you as employee, you‚Äôd just be a contractor they can break off any moment. I would suggest thinking of this as either flat fee per project, or flat fee per period. You can give them 2 options. The former is more suitable (to them) if there is not constant occupancy with tasks, the latter will allow them to make you work more for the same (the usual dynamics really, is fine).

On the contrary, **Tether engages in a bunch of private lending, credit, and all other volatile stuff to make money.** That is how it can demonstrate abnormal profits, more than if 90% of its reserves were in treasuries.

Probably, anything that has stETH as collateral or makes yields with the use of that? Then it would even be good dinosaurs like Yearn and Instadapp. As well as Gearbox, Alchemix, and so on.

As an act of socialism, but in this case it could be justified. This hasn‚Äôt happened yet though, and the [vote Lido had didn‚Äôt think so](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2).

The current liquidity on all DEXes combined (that disregards off-chain demand, options, and any other not currently bidding on-chain seen amounts) - is about $125M, according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance). So is the ratio quite alarming, or do people say so?\n",

      "[Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644) (known as math brains) is advising Aave DAO to limit the usage of CRV as collateral. Because what happens is the following: CRV goes down -> 0x7a16ff can add more CRV to support HF (health factor) of their position -> etc... but liquidity is finite! As noted above, $125M now. A simple solution is to simply disallow new loans based off CRV. Not to punish, just stop the domination.\n",
      "\n",
      "ü§î At the same time, other DAO members of Aave seem to be appalled by this __attack__ on the community member that has violated nothing and just keeps using math as intended: \"You have no idea whether he intends to repay the loan. He may be ecstatic to lose 45% of his collateral‚Äôs value, as you noted. But on the other hand, he may believe CRV is massively undervalued, and hence would rather borrow against his CRV holdings than sell at these ridiculously low prices. We just don‚Äôt know. What we do know is his HF at this point is totally fine.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, HF for this open position is 1.68 = ok. However, if this rate experiences a decline and falls below the critical threshold of 1.00, an automatic liquidation of the collateral will occur. The current liquidation price of the position is $0.374, and $CRV is trading at $0.64 now. Ok? Idk. ‚ÄúAT LEAST KNOWN 24% of all CRVs are on the founder‚Äôs wallets, with one of the most locked tokens today (and only 15% free float available to sell). At current AMM liquidity, you literally cannot get the price down low enough.‚Äù - [says](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1668351302386999318) threadman Adam. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again though, this post isn't to find someone guilty or blame - the fact is, oracles & collaterals are HARD. Mostly because of how often things change, like liquidity and CMC/FDV. In many cases, you don't even know who the largest LPs are for a token - and if they are connected at all. Because if the are connected, it means the market is controlled and thus can be manipulated. It's unlikely that this is the case here, just presenting a theory.\n",

      "3) Due to redemptions mechanisms being based off the market liquidity in many cases, due to low liquidity, shit can spiral\n",

      "\n",
      "1Ô∏è‚É£ The behavior of a hook can vary.\n",
      "To ensure the pool works correctly with the hook, it is necessary to deploy the hook in a way that obtains the correct initial bits of its address. This requires mining the addresses for hooks contracts: https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/2f9b30663b53c0165cd6d34651d8ff13287667c4/contracts/libraries/Hooks.sol#L8\n",
      "\n",
      "2Ô∏è‚É£ Another interesting point: the Uniswap team implemented the SafeTransfer part in a similar way to Algebra V2.0, which caused some integration issues on zksync Era:\n",

      "\n",
      "(Luckily enough, zkSync ended up releasing a compiler update)\n",

      "3Ô∏è‚É£ It is worth noting that Uniswap chose to keep the bitmap as the data structure for the ticks, while we prefer using a doubly linked list, which makes large swaps cheaper with our model: https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/TickBitmap.sol\n",
      "\n",

      "4Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs more? #UniV4 decided to remove all the side information from the ticks. Previously, it contained additional data that could be used to calculate various statistics, but traders had to pay for it. In the fourth implementation of Uniswap, such data will not be stored:\n",

Treating developers like YouTubers overlooks the huge upfront costs that almost any innovative project incurs. Additionally, it doesn't benefit projects that are just starting and haven't yet found the right product-market fit (since they still lack enough users). This model might work as a help for big protocols, helping them avoid selling their tokens, which is positive, of course, but I don't see any clear benefits beyond that. 343849239\n",

A DAO is not a legal corporate form in itself. The concept of a DAO was little known to the general world until the SEC‚Äôs 2017 DAO Report that analyzed operations of a DAO. But even five years after the DAO Report, the regulators still maintain that a DAO may be viewed as an unincorporated association. Currently, there are thousands of DAOs, some of which are structured as corporations, some ‚Äì as limited liability companies, some ‚Äì as unincorporated nonprofit associations, and some ‚Äì as offshore entities. However, most of the DAOs do not associate with any form of legal entity. By default, these DAOs are general partnerships, and therefore, unincorporated associations. They still carry legal liability for the actions of their members, and since there is no limited liability shield, the group liability becomes the liability of each individual member of such DAO. 95188025\n",
